## About

This C# was created out of necessity to host/view my own recipes on multiple devices. It is just a framework for adding, editing, deleting and categorize recipes from a hosted website.<br/>
IMPORTANT: This is not a hosted service, you will need to host it yourself if you want your own recipe manager.

## Planned features

- Change from JSON files as a "database" (slow) to something that is still local, as a file, but faster (SQLite?)
- Some sort of login, or accounts in general. Not everyone should be allowed to edit/deleting recipes
