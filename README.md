## About

This C# project was created out of necessity to host/view my own recipes on multiple devices. It is just a framework
for adding, editing, deleting and categorizing recipes from a hosted website.<br/>
**IMPORTANT: This is not a hosted service, you will need to host it yourself if you want your own recipe manager.**

This is basically a database that stores recipe tables and uses a web interface to view and edit them.

## Features

- Uses SQLite as its database, fast and efficient.
- Several ways of setting it up, should cover most users.

## Planned features

- Some sort of admin login, or accounts in general. Not everyone should be allowed to edit/deleting recipes.
- Instruction photos in the description of the recipe, might help some users.

## Known issues

- Adding new tags to a recipe doesn't do anything

## How to set up
